-Micro SD card slot was abandoned due to high power usage
-Accelerometer was chosen because it could speak SPI and has low power consumption
-Pretty cool that one device is CS and the other is \CS, huh? Got lucky.
-When using an ATtiny as a SPI master, hook your MOSI signal to the DO pin, and MISO signal to the DI pin. When using an ATtiny as a SPI slave, hook your MOSI signal to the DI pin, and MISO signal to the DO pin.
-Looked at using rechargable coin cell, but they have much lower mAh ratings than non rechargable, so I'm sticking with the non rechargables for now.


Version 1.1 changes:
-Removed stop around vias so the battery doesn't short to them
-Fixed USB port footprint so it has mechanical/ground pads
-Fixed DO/DI pins from Flash and Accelerometer to ATTiny
-Updated battery holder footprint to fit smaller area, so I don't have to grind anything off after fab.
-Fixed ISP programming header (add gnd, remove unneeded pins).
-Moved stuff on RESET to another pin
-Fixed CS pins
-Fixed USB port
-Removed interrupt from accelerometer
-Marked pullup for Flash as DNP, since it will screw up USB and I don't think it's actually needed.


-swap accel with mic and flash with cc1101, same form factor as nanologger
cc430 with radio needs 2v. Energy harvester to get 2v?
TPS62730 for better battery life
