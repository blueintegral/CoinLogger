-Micro SD card slot was abandoned due to high power usage
-Accelerometer was chosen because it could speak SPI and has low power consumption
-Pretty cool that one device is CS and the other is \CS, huh? Got lucky.


Future rev: solder rechargable coin cell to reduce thickness and charge over USB.

Version 1.1 changes:
-Removed stop around vias so the battery doesn't short to them
-TODO: Fix USB port footprint so it has mechanical/ground pads
-TODO: Confirm DO/DI pins from device to ATTiny
-TODO: Update battery holder footprint to fit smaller area, so I don't have to grind anything off after fab.
