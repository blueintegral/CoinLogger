-Micro SD card slot was abandoned due to high power usage
-Accelerometer was chosen because it could speak SPI and has low power consumption
-Pretty cool that one device is CS and the other is \CS, huh? Got lucky.
-When using an ATtiny as a SPI master, hook your MOSI signal to the DO pin, and MISO signal to the DI pin. When using an ATtiny as a SPI slave, hook your MOSI signal to the DI pin, and MISO signal to the DO pin.
-Looked at using rechargable coin cell, but they have much lower mAh ratings than non rechargable, so I'm sticking with the non rechargables for now.


Version 1.1 changes:
-Removed stop around vias so the battery doesn't short to them
-Fixed USB port footprint so it has mechanical/ground pads
-Fixed DO/DI pins from Flash and Accelerometer to ATTiny
-Updated battery holder footprint to fit smaller area, so I don't have to grind anything off after fab.


4 layer version? Might actually be cheaper if I can get it smaller.
